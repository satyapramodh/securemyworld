A prototype android app which captures a picture, determines emotional state of the person.

Aim:
1. To deploy such app to IOT cameras which capture images/video constantly.
2. To analyze the emotional state of people in the captured shots and determine a threat.
3. Threats could be suicidal, terror related.
4. An emotionally distraught person could show signs of depression, sadness before commiting a suicide. What if we could anticipate such a scenario? To detect objects or environments around him/her. Like knife, gun or place (rooftops) and alert emergency services of a possible incident so they can be avoided? We aim to solve that.

We also have a chat bot which tries to solve the same issues. Contribute to that [here](https://github.com/satyapramodh/securemyworldbot)
